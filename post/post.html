      <p class="content">
        Most people think about emotional intelligence as a skill, something you
        can build and train with practice. And while this is partly true,
        there’s a deeper truth about emotional intelligence that most of us
        miss: Improving your emotional intelligence is often about what you do
        less of, not more of. As a psychologist, I work with many people who
        look like though they don’t have much emotional intelligence: They blame
        other people for their problems They trap themselves in cycles of stress
        and anxiety They self-sabotage as soon as they start to make progress
        But it’s my experience that most people don’t actually lack the capacity
        for emotional intelligence. In fact, I think most people already have a
        high degree of emotional intelligence. Unfortunately, many people are
        held back from using their innate emotional intelligence by a collection
        of bad habits that get in the way. If you’d like to improve your
        emotional intelligence, learn to identify these habits in your own life
        and work to eliminate them. I think you’ll find that your natural
        emotional intelligence is not far behind. <br> <h2 class="sub_caption">1. Criticizing Others</h2>
        <p class="sub_content">
            Criticizing others is often an unconscious defense mechanism aimed at
        alleviating our own insecurities. We’re all critical sometimes. And it’s
        not necessarily a bad thing — to think carefully and critically about
        the world around us is a vital skill. It helps us navigate the world and
        our relationships in an objective way. But too much criticism —
        especially the habit of being critical of others — can lead to the
        opposite of objectivity: it can make us narrow-minded and blind,
        especially to ourselves. One of the reasons it’s so easy to slip into
        habitually criticizing others is that it makes us feel good: When you
        point out to yourself that someone else is dumb, you’re also implying
        that you’re smart. And that feels good. When you criticize someone else
        for being naive, what you’re really doing it telling yourself that
        you’re sophisticated. And that feels good. When you silently chuckle to
        yourself about how terrible someone’s fashion sense is, you’re telling
        yourself how refined your own taste is. And that feels good. Helpful
        criticism is about making the world better. Unhelpful criticism is about
        making yourself feel better. While being critical might temporarily make
        you feel good about yourself, it usually makes you feel worse about
        yourself in the long-term. On the other hand, emotionally intelligent
        and self-aware people understand that criticizing others is just a
        primitive defense mechanism. And that there are far better, more
        productive ways of dealing with our anxieties and insecurities. Without
        knowing it, people who are constantly critical of others are really just
        trying to alleviate their own insecurities. Understand that criticism of
        others is a waste of time and energy because it’s all time and energy
        that’s not getting invested in improving yourself and the world around
        you. “Criticism of others is a form of self-commendation. We think we
        make the picture hang straight on our wall by telling our neighbors that
        all his pictures are crooked.” ― Fulton J. Sheen
        </p> <br> <h2 class="sub_caption">2. Worrying About the
            Future</h2> <p class="sub_content">
                Worrying about the future means living in denial about the
        fundamentally uncertain nature of life. As human beings we crave order
        and certainty. And for good reason: Our ancestors who were better at
        making their lives a little less uncertain probably survived longer than
        those who didn’t. We’re biologically motivated to reduce uncertainty.
        But there’s a big difference between taking reasonable steps to reduce
        uncertainty and being so terrified by it that we delude ourselves into
        believing we can eliminate it altogether. And that’s what chronic
        worriers do. They’re so afraid of uncertainty, and so unwilling to live
        with it, that they trick themselves into thinking they can make the
        future less uncertain — by thinking about it constantly! Chronic
        worriers live under the illusion that thinking is always problem-solving
        and that planning always leads to greater levels of preparedness. But
        neither of those are true: Just because you’re thinking about a problem
        doesn’t mean you’re thinking about it productively. And just because
        you’re planning — running through countless hypothetical future
        scenarios — doesn’t mean you’re any better equipped to handle them.
        Often, you’re just making yourself feel more prepared. Worry gives you
        the illusion of certainty. But in the end, all it does is fragilize you.
        Emotionally intelligent people understand that life is inherently
        uncertain. And they understand that it’s better to face up to this
        reality clear-eyed than to live in denial about it. Because when you
        stop beating yourself down with all the stress and anxiety that comes
        with chronic worry, you’d be surprised how much energy and enthusiasm
        returns to your life. When you stop insisting that the world act the way
        you want it to tomorrow, it becomes far easier to work with the world
        you’ve got today. “Worry does not empty tomorrow of its sorrow, it
        empties today of its strength.” ― Corrie Ten Boom
            </p> <br> <h2 class="sub_caption">3. Ruminating on the
            Past</h2> <p class="sub_content">Ruminating on past mistakes is a misguided attempt at control. Just
                like we humans crave order and certainty, we also crave control. We’re
                obsessed with the idea that, with enough effort and perseverance, we can
                do or achieve anything. Of course, most people who get stuck ruminating
                endlessly on past mistakes and failures don’t actually believe that they
                can change the past. Instead, ruminating about the past gives the them
                the illusion of control, however fleeting and temporary. When you’ve
                done something bad or made a mistake in the past, you naturally feel
                guilt and regret. Chronic ruminators develop the unconscious habit of
                constantly replaying past mistakes because it briefly gives them a
                feeling of control. And feeling in control helps distract from feeling
                helpless — which is what we really are when it comes to past mistakes.
                In reality, no amount of rumination or analysis of your past mistakes
                will change what happened. Which means helplessness and powerlessness
                are inevitable. This is a hard fact of life that emotionally intelligent
                people not only understand, but accept. If you want to move on with your
                life instead of staying stuck in the past, you must accept the past for
                what it is—including feeling helpless. You must give up the choice to
                endlessly revisit it, no matter how much it distracts you from your real
                pain — the pain of helplessness. When in doubt, take action in the
                present instead of dwelling on the past. Do something useful, right now,
                now matter how small — and resist the temptation to replay yet another
                scene from your past. Don’t give up control over your future by
                pretending you can control the past. “To think too much is a disease.” ―
                Fyodor Dostoyevsky</p> <br> <h2 class="sub_caption">
                    4. Maintaining Unrealistic Expectations</h2><p class="sub_content">Unrealistic
                        expectations are a misguided attempt to control other people. Just like
                        ruminating is an attempt to control the past and how we feel about it,
                        maintaining unrealistic expectations is usually a subtle attempt to
                        control other people. Of course, most people with unrealistic
                        expectations don’t see it that way. You probably see your expectations
                        of other people as a good thing: Having high expectations for people
                        encourages them to grow and mature and become their best self! Maybe,
                        but this is still a subtle form of control. You have an idea for what
                        another person in your life should be or do or accomplish and your
                        expectation is your way of trying to make it happen. But what does it
                        mean, exactly, to maintain an unrealistic expectation? Simply put, it
                        means you spend time crafting stories in your head about what other
                        people should do. And when they inevitably fail to live up to those
                        standards, you reflexively compare reality to those expectations and
                        feel frustrated and disappointed. And how do you respond to this
                        frustration and disappointment? By creating even stronger and more
                        elaborate expectations, because it makes you feel good and in control!
                        Look, of course you care about the people in your life and want the best
                        for them. And it pains you to see them hurting or struggling or
                        suffering. So, when you create a story in your mind about them
                        succeeding and doing better (i.e. an expectation) you feel a little
                        better. The problem is, you can’t actually control other people, even
                        for the better. Not nearly as much as you would like, anyway. Which
                        means you create a constant vicious cycle of sky-high hopes and grave
                        disappointments and frustrations. What’s more, eventually your attempts
                        at control begin to be felt by the people in your life and they become
                        resentful. And if it goes on long enough, they may even act contrary to
                        your expectations simply out of spite! The solution is to let go of your
                        expectations. Stop creating stories about what you want for other
                        people. And instead, just be present for the person they are: Validate
                        their current struggles instead of daydreaming about their future
                        successes. Set real boundaries on their behavior instead of wishing for
                        perfection. Meet them where they are instead of where you want them to
                        be. Hang on to your hopes but let go of your expectations. “He was
                        swimming in a sea of other people’s expectations. Men had drowned in
                        seas like that.” ― Robert Jordan All You Need to Know If you want to
                        increase your emotional intelligence, try approaching the problem
                        backwards: Instead of trying to improve your emotional intelligence
                        skills, strive to identify and eliminate the habits that are interfering
                        with your natural emotional intelligence in the first place. Stop
                        criticizing others. Stop worrying about the future. Stop ruminating on
                        the past. Stop expecting too much of others.</p>
